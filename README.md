# Weather App

Welcome to my Weather App repository! üå¶Ô∏è

This project is a simple weather application built using React.js. As a beginner in React, I've incorporated key concepts such as `useState` hook and `useEffect` hook to manage the state and lifecycle of the components, respectively.

## Features

- **React.js:** Utilized the power of React to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **useState Hook:** Managed state in functional components to handle dynamic data and user interactions.
- **useEffect Hook:** Implemented lifecycle methods with the `useEffect` hook for fetching and updating data.
- **Open Weather API Integration:** Integrated the Open Weather API to provide real-time weather data.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Improvements
As a beginner in React, I acknowledge that there is always room for improvement. Here are some areas I plan to work on to make this Weather App even better:

- **UI/UX Enhancements:** Improve the overall look and feel of the application.
- **Error Handling:** Implement better error handling for API requests.
- **Performance Optimization:** Optimize the application for better performance.
- Feel free to contribute or provide feedback! I'm open to learning and growing as a React developer. üòä
